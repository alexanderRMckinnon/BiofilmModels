    "# Introduction\n",
    "The model captures biofilm growth by considering the interaction between *Bacillus* cells and the extracellular matrix (ECM) that they produce. Previous research has shown that the ECM inhibits cell movement, and thus can lead to areas of higher density. The variation in cell density is believed to cause a heterogeneous cell-death pattern, which ultimatley leads to wrinkle formation. \n",

    "This model assumes all cells are motile and become imotile due to high levels of ECM."
